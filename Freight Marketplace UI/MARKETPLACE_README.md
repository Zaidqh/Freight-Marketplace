## 🎯 Key Features

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Load Posting Flow**

2. Form data is validated and collected
3. Load is saved to localStorage (in production: database)
4. User is redirected to marketplace to see their load
5. Load appears at the top of the marketplace list

### **Data Storage**
- **Local Storage**: `duff.marketplace.loads` - stores all posted loads
- **Message Storage**: `duff.messages` - stores communication between parties
- **Sample Data**: Pre-loaded sample loads for demonstration

### **Integration Points**
- **loads.html**: Posts new loads to marketplace
- **marketplace.html**: Displays all loads and handles messaging
